# This file contains the pixel positions of test sources generated by
# PhoSim from InstanceCatalogs created by running the
#
# generate_rotational_catalogs.py
#
# script in this directory.  The locations of these sources will be used
# to verify that the CatSim camera model and focal plane coordinate convention
# agrees with the focal plane coordinate conventions of PhoSim.
